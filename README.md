# REDACTR - SCRAMBLE SOME WORDS FROM A BODY OF TEXT CONTEN

---

## Description

A simple web-based application that allows users to redact specific words in a given text. Redacting text means replacing sensitive or unwanted words with a specified character, typically asterisks (***), to hide the content. This can be useful when sharing content on social media or other platforms while protecting sensitive information.
